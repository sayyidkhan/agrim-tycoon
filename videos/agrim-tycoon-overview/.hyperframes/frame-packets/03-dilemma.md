## Frame 3 — The Mayor's Dilemma

- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/03-dilemma.html
- duration: 12s
- poster: 6s
- transition_in: cut
- scene: A critical city decision arrives as the Machine City and Talent Network cards collide in a consequential choice.
- voiceover: ""
- narrativeRole: pain_point
- blueprint: comparison-split
- asset_candidates: assets/field-manual-machines.jpg — Machine City card; assets/field-manual-recruit.jpg — Talent Network card

The game changes from a city-builder into a leadership test. City systems create real tradeoffs: scale the machines, invest in people, or risk leaving either behind. The frame states the tension without inventing metrics or pretending a model chooses for the player.

**Shot sequence**

- `0.0–3.0s` — A hard cut creates two opposing source-art cards: Machine City on the left, Talent Network on the right. Layout: exact balanced split with a central decision line. Motion: split-tilt cards enter from opposing sides.
- `3.0–8.0s` — One phrase lands at a time: “SCALE THE MACHINES.” / “INVEST IN PEOPLE.” / “OWN THE TRADEOFF.” Motion: kinetic beat slams, paced across the cards.
- `8.0–12.0s` — The cards pull toward a single mayor marker at center. Layout: a human decision point visually wins over both systems. Motion: slow nudge-curve into the Gemma advisory reveal.

## Selected blueprint: comparison-split

# comparison-split — Comparison Split-Cards

**intent**: Two paired items of equal weight shown side-by-side with mirrored 3D "book-open" tilts — the eye reads them as a balanced comparison, then a pill badge lands at each card's inner edge to punctuate. The motion IS the symmetry: two cards arriving from opposite wings into a held spread.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `comparison-split-cards`): when two complementary features / capabilities of equal weight should be presented **simultaneously, not sequentially** — an A/B, a "X + Y together," paired concepts the viewer must weigh side-by-side. Not for >2 items (use `grid-card-assemble`) or sequential steps.

**duration**: 4–6s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas carrying two faint ambient glow blooms — `[accent A]` near 30%, `[accent B]` near 70% — so each side owns a color identity across a 50% symmetry axis; equal-width cards under one shared perspective parent)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~0.8s) — title sets the concept.** A centered `[title line]` with an `[accent keyword]` slides DOWN into place from just above (a short smooth settle). The downward arrival is deliberate: it forms a non-conflicting T-shape against the cards, which arrive from the sides next.
- **Scene 2 (~0.4–1.9s) — the split-tilt entry (signature move).** Two equal-width feature cards arrive from opposite wings — `[left card]` from the left, `[right card]` from the right ~0.2s behind — each carrying a **mirrored 3D `rotateY` tilt** (left faces right, right faces left, opening like a book) and scaling ~0.85→1 as it lands. The entry overlaps the title's tail so the whole thing reads as ONE arrival, not two beats. Each card holds `[image / label / subtitle]`; box-shadows fall **outward** from the tilt (left shadow right, right shadow left).
- **Scene 3 (~1.9–end) — badges punctuate, then hold.** A pill `[badge]` lands at each card's **inner edge** (left then right, ~0.3s apart), overlapping its card ~15% so it reads as attached, not orbiting. This is the lone overshoot in the shot — it earns the punctuation. Settles and holds.

**motion vocabulary**: title slide-down from above; mirrored opposite-wing card entry; static book-open `rotateY` tilt (`+tilt` left, `−tilt` right); tilt-matched outward box-shadow; inner-edge badge spring-pop; gentle phase-opposed idle float (left vs right, never synchronized) registered as subtle jitter; dual side-glow ambient.

**rule mapping**

- two cards entering from opposite wings with mirrored `rotateY` tilts + tilt-matched shadow → `split-tilt-cards` (the signature; keep the two-layer split so the entry `x`/`scale` and the idle never collide on one alias)
- title slide-down settle → `gsap-effects` (translate + opacity on a long-tail `power3`)
- inner-edge pill badge pop (the one overshoot) → `spring-pop-entrance` (overshoot register — earns the punctuation)
- phase-opposed idle float on the pair → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, NOT lazy breathing; left `sin(t)`, right `sin(t+π)` so they never conveyor-belt)
- the two faint side glows behind the cards → `ambient-glow-bloom` (un-triggered soft bloom, one per accent)

**camera modifier**: camera-static by default — the symmetry is the subject and a move would break the balance.

## Selected motion rule: nudge-curve

---
name: nudge-curve
description: Slow-fast-slow three-phase group slide — reposition a composed group (word rows, card stacks, lists) to reveal content or make room. No single built-in ease produces it; chain power3.in ramp → linear burst → power4.out tail (10/65/25 distance, tail ≥3× ramp-in in time).

# Nudge Curve

Slow-fast-slow repositioning of a composed group (word rows, card stacks, lists) to
reveal content or make room. **In-scene group slide — not a seam.** No single built-in
ease produces it — `power4.inOut` smacks to a stop. Chain three tweens on one property:

| Phase     | Ease            | Distance | Time | Feel                                     |
| --------- | --------------- | -------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 ramp-in | `power3.in`     | ~10%     | ~20% | barely moves — motion registers, no jolt |
| 2 burst   | `none` (linear) | ~65%     | ~18% | ~2× average px/frame — purposeful        |
| 3 tail    | `power4.out`    | ~25%     | ~62% | decaying creep to rest — kills the smack |

## Rules

- The tail is ≥3× the ramp-in in TIME. If it still smacks: extend the tail's time (not
  distance) or use `power5.out`.
- Phase 2 stays linear — easing it loses the burst contrast.
- Reveal new content DURING phase 2 — the burst masks its appearance.
- Same ratios vertical; scale distances proportionally, keep the time ratios.
- A cascade arrival usually precedes this slide — see [waterfall-entry.md](waterfall-entry.md).

## JS

Reference values for a 270px leftward slide (0.57s total). Scale distances
proportionally for other travels; preserve the TIME ratios; tail ≥3× ramp-in.

```js
var t = /* start after content settles */;
tl.to(".text-row", { x: -30,  duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in"  }, t);          // ramp-in: 11% dist / 21% time
tl.to(".text-row", { x: -210, duration: 0.10, ease: "none"       }, t + 0.12);   // burst:   67% dist / 18% time
tl.to(".text-row", { x: -270, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out" }, t + 0.22);   // tail:    22% dist / 61% time
// vertical: same ratios on y. 150px variant: -15 / -115 / -150 at the same times.
```

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                    | Instead                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Single ease for a group slide (`power4.inOut`, `slow()`) | The three-phase chain above              |
| Nudge tail shorter than 3× the ramp-in                   | Extend the tail's TIME, not its distance |
